/**
 * A simplified client for accessing the UC Web service
 * 
 * Because the WSDL document contains enough information to let clients communicate with the Web service, 
 * you can alternatively use the <b>wsimport</b> tool to generate client-support code from this document, 
 * to facilitate creating the client. In the context of UC, you would use this tool as follows:
 * 
 * wsimport -keep â€“p client http://localhost:9901/UC?wsdl
